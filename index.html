    <h2>Atmospheric noise from the edge of the web</h2>
    <p>
      Yeo. I’m Rekrypt. — an electronic artist and producer based in Calgary, AB.
      I make music that’s vivid, disorienting, and immersive. Warping through
      genres like Acid, Bass, and Breaks, I lean into gritty basslines and esoteric melodies
      to craft soundscapes that feel experimental but intentional.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work is rooted in a love of late-century digital media, underground bass culture,
      and emotional experience. It comes out as dark, percussive, defective rhythms—
      stuff that makes you want to glitch out on the dancefloor. For me, music is about
      expressing something inaccessible—like bleeding battery acid, analyzing anagrams,
      or Deni Stilton’s Tooth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond sound, I design and program custom visuals for my sets and streams—layered,
      glitch-heavy, and stark. I draw from chiaroscuro lighting and fragmented digital textures,
      inspired by artists like Ryoji Ikeda, Hiromasa Ogura, David Lynch, and Albrecht Dürer.
      My visual language mirrors my music: abstract, sharp, and intentionally disorienting.
